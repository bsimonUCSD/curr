Installation:

1.  Set up curr as a Racket collection.

    Go to the parent directory of curr, and do the following:

    $ raco link curr


2.  Run build.rkt to generate the curriculum.  You can do this either
at the command line, or from DrRacket.

    $ racket build.rkt

    To generate the curriculum under a different tagging context,
    provide additional arguments to the build.rkt program.  e.g:

    $ racket build.rkt pedagogy group

    Under DrRacket, you can change your Language settings to include
    the tags as custom command line arguments.
